# Data-Assimilation-Models-for-Probability-Distributions

## Problem description

This repository implements the ensemble data assimilation algorithm described in [1] for predictnig the PDFs in complex turbulent systems. 

## To run an experiment


To compare performance of different filters on the triad system, run the following command:

```
matlab run_filter_triad_model.m
```




## Dependencies

* MATLAB
